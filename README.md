üõ†Ô∏è Code Structure
The code is divided into modular functions for ease of understanding and maintenance:

`generate_problem()`: Generates a random math problem using defined operands and operators. Ensures divisions have integer results.
`select_difficulty()`: Allows the user to select the game's difficulty.
`main()`: Controls the main game flow, including timing, answer counting, and statistics calculation.
